paragraph4 = "it was a mood She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken She was just having a good cry all to herself The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps"
paragraph5 = "Stranded Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that was of little consequence Her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her She looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order She was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last"

paragraph8 = "Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information He knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field, Josh would be the one to call The problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it Years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic"
paragraph9 = "Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency So I try"

paragraph16 = "It was a scrape that he hardly noticed Sure, there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures There was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream He felt perfectly normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him"
paragraph17 = "It was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but hed finally taken the hint and asked her out After all the time and effort shed invested into it, she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful It goes without saying that things work out quite as she expected"
